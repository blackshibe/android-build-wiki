# android-build-wiki

Knowledge base for the build wiki. This is mainly information gathered by me in my own times working with Android, and may not be accurate. 

## Contributing

If there is **anything** you know as a ROM builder that isn't on this wiki and may not be obvious to a beginner, please share it here. Custom ROMs suffer from a lack of centralized information on basically any part of the build beyond extremely basic build guides.
